<h1 style="text-align: center">THEME</h1>
<p style="text-align: center"> Our theme will be “To Unite and To Save Earth". We will have posters of nature and trees around the workshop, as well as some paintings about scenarios on how to recycle well. We will also have cutouts of people holding hands together that can be made by our participants or us.<br> <br> <br> We decided to put a lot of greens, blues, oranges, whites, and even some grays in our workshop to effectively relate the whole event to the topic that our team is holding. </p>

Solid Waste Management helps lessen and prevent polution. In this workshop, we will teach you how to appropriately dispose your wastes, introduce the causes and effects of waste disposal, its importance and advantages and disadvantages. Our goal is to help the planet by the power of knowledge and unity of people. The workshop is arranged in order to save the earth from a

<h1 style="text-align: center">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h1>
<p style="text-align: center"> Our team came up with a solution called "BinBin Machine"; this is the solution that we thought of to help us prevent and lessen pollution that we are experiencing due to our daily wastes. We want to help the nature and this machine would help people learn how to separate trash (i.e., recyclable, non-biodegradable, biodegradable and electronic wastes). Ergo, even in that way people will learn to throw garbage properly. We came up with this solution by deciding and discussing if this would
literally help our ecosystem and can reduce/prevent future problems. <p>

 <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 30px"><em>Our team plans to propose a product called “BinBin Machine”. It is similar to a vending machine, however it exchanges money for recyclable/reusable materials. The money that the machine exchanges will depend on how much their items are valued, for there will be a scanner in each category and a weighing machine. We also plan to include biodegradable wastes that will be distributed to farmers or to workers that may convert it to fertilizers. The machine’s rubbish will be collected  (3) thrice a week 
and will get checked everyday regarding the amount of rubbish that has been collected and how much money is left. Maintenance will be implemented once a month to assure that our machine will work efficiently.</em></p>
